# Itellij_working_with_MYSQL
A simple user interface to have intellij run queries on MySQL
This application runs in pair with a linux virtual machine that is running on my device. So there might be an issue if you don't have a connection to a seperate machine. 
You'll need to change the name of the schema if you changed the name in your MYSQL. 

user name : student
password : password
